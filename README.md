# Service System Design Framework

Contains a multi-level design framework for designing service systems. 


# Content

**SimplyGo_ServiceSystem** holds the framework, based on a real-life use-case of the digital platform "SimplyGo". The framework consits of...

 - A Context Map ("SimplyGo_ContextMap.png")
 - A complete view of the SimplyGo service system ("SimplyGo_ServiceSystem.png")
 - Image files of each bounded context
 
**UseCase_RequestTestRequirement** holds UML diagrams of a short use-case. The use-case demonstrates how the framework can help to design a service system. The diagrams represent a system in which a traveler can request personalized test requirements for entering a foreign country during a trip, based on individual health data. 

Other folders hold code of a project to create the SimplyGo framework, using ContextMapper and PlantUML.
